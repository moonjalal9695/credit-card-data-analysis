This project focuses on analyzing credit risk by examining loan application data using PostgreSQL for data processing, SQL views for analysis, and Power BI for interactive dashboarding. It demonstrates real-world data analytics workflows including data importing, transformation, aggregation, and visualization. The project helps identify patterns in loan defaults based on customer demographics, income types, and occupation, which is valuable for financial risk teams or lending institutions.

Key outcomes:

Created reusable SQL views to calculate default rates and financial metrics

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with cards, bar charts, tables, and slicers

Integrated data across SQL and BI tools for a complete analytics portfolio project
